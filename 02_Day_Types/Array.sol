/*Array elements can be of mapping and struct as well
In that mappings can only be stored in the Storage data location.*/

//.push() appends a zero initialized elements.

//Use keccak256-hash for string manipulation

//bytes[] tightly packed in calldata and memory.
//bytes1[] in "memory" adds 31 padding bytes between elements

//In "storage" padding is absent due to tight packing.

//string for t=utf-8 coding, but bytes is much cheaper, so use bytes in man cases.
