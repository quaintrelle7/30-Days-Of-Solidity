- Contrcats in solidity are similar to classes in OOPs languages.
- Calling a function perform an EVM function call.
- Contrcats can be created from outside via ethereum transactions or from within Solidity contracts.
- A constructor is optional, only one is allowed, overloading is not supported.
- After the constructor has executed the final code is stored on the blockchain.
- The code includes: all public, external functions and the functions that are reachable from function calls.
- The code not includes: constructor code or internal functions
- Internally, constructor arguments are passed ABI encoded after the code of contract.
- Cyclic creation dependencies ain't possible.
