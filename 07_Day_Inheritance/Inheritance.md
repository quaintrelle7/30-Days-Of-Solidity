# Inheritance

- Supports Polymorphism
- Multiple Inhertance is Possible
- virtual keyword -- function can change its behaviour in derived class
- To override a function use override and virtual keyword
- Possible to call a specific overridden function.
- Specifying just 'override' and not 'virtual' doesn't change the behaviour of the function.
